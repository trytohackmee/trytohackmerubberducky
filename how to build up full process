Here i am using a ARDUINO pro micro board for making it.
STEP 1:  At First download the arduino software in your system.
  STEP 2: copy the code from my wifi-password-grabbing file.
  STEP 3: as the scirpt is for rubber ducky so we need to convert it for our arduino board.
  STEP 4: here we use https://techchip.net/ducky/ for converting.
STEP 5: Before covert it make sure you need to change the 22 no. line (your server) . open https://webhook.site/ and copy you Unique url put it here. 
STEP 6: Now convert it and copy the generated script and paste it in the arduino software.
